        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p> This week's assignment was to design and create a kinetic sculpture using at least two materials, at least one static joint,
            and at least one prismatic joint. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <h4>Materials and Software Used</h4>
        <p>Laser cutter, Fusion 360, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, hand drill, scroll saw, hand saw, DC motor</p><br>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>During class, we received a tour of the entirety of the lab and were introduced to the drill press, the scroll saw,
            hand drills, as well as a variety of saws and knives. We also learned how to solder wires onto a motor and protoboard as well 
            as the accompanying pain of desoldering using electrical tape and the soldering gun. 
            <p>&Tab; <b>Drill Press:</b> a machine primarily used for creating cylindrical cuts or drilling holes, set on a fixed stand </p><p></p>
            <p>&Tab; <b>Scroll Saw:</b> a small electrical saw used to cut precise curves in wood, certail metals, and other materials</pre></p>
            <p>Other terms that were discussed: </p>
            <p>&Tab;<b>Saws:</b>types used: hand saw, jeweler's saw, Japanese pull saw, and hacksaw<p>
            
        </p><br>

        <h3>My Kinetic Sculpture</h3>
        <p>Make a moving thing? Gears? Wood? Sounded like the perfect recipe for making a clock! We're surrounded by clocks! How difficult could that be?   
        </p>
        <p>After doing some googling on simple wooden gear clocks, I stumbled upon Clayton Boyer's Genesis Wooden Gear Clock, deemed 
            as one of the simplest clocks by the builder as well as woodworking magazines. Instead of buying the plans, I went off of some 
            of the pictures posted by other individuals who had docummented their work online. Looked simple enough!

        <p>Using Fusion 360, I created the spur gears -- four large ones for the clock faces and three smaller driving gears.
          The base of the clock consisted of   
         </p>
         <p>It was difficult to navigate the pen with the given constraints but I was able to work my way around by creating 
             my own ruler using the rectangle tool (the rulers weren't that accurate and required some eye straining...). </p>

              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>Using the design mentioned above, I used the general shape of the leaves and the tree but customized the 
                    branches in a way that was easier to create with the pen tool on Illustrator. After finding the thickness of 
                    the cardboard (4.42 mm), I created the notches on the leaves and branches as well as the tree bark, making sure 
                    to make the widths slightly smaller to account for the kerf (this was done mostly through approximation).

                <p>I set the minimum power to 100%, the max power to 100%, and the speed to 50 (need units).</p>

              <h4>The pieces after the cut:</h3>
                <p>It turned out a lot better than I thought and I was quite surprised that my approximations led to perfect fits 
                    for all of the leaves! Some of the branches were a little too thin at the ends and so some of it broke off
                    but hey, if you can't see it, it doesn't exist!
