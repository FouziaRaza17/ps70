      <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p> This week's assignment was to demonstrate 2 microcontrollers communicating over wired or radio connection. </p><br>
      <h4>Materials and Software Used</h4>
        <p>Arduino Unos, Arduino/C, nRF24 module, servo motor, LEDs </p><br>
      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Having two microcontrollers communicate with each other
            is highly useful in remotely controlling actuators and output
            devices. When looking at the bigger picture, it is imperative in 
            controlling robots, setting up a home automation system, 
            monitoring sensor data, etc.  </p>
        <p>I first connected two microncontrollers using universal
            asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART), which takes bytes
            of data and transmits the individual bits in a sequenctial 
            fashion. Asynchronous means that the data is transferred without the need 
            of an external clock signal. This minimizes the number of wires 
            required for connection and I/O pins. It is therefore widely used 
            in everyday electronics that include GPS, Bluetooth, or serial LCDs. 
        </p>
        <p>For both of my circuits, I wired my microncontrollers together using 
            the RX, TX pins.A serial bus consists of two wires -- one from the sending data (TX) and  
            another for receiving (RX). Therefore, the RX pin on the receiver should be connected to the 
            TX pin on the transmitter and the RX pin on the transmitter should be connected to the TX pin
            on the receiver. Since I make one solely the receiver and one just a transmitter, the serial interface 
            was simply a half-duplex in that communication means serial devices take turns sending and 
            receiving. 
        </p><br>
      <h3>Hello Received! </h3>
        <p>Since I couldn't get my SAMD board to work (and kind of forgot tha I could have used the 
            feather this whole time) I decided to use two Arduino boards that I had made sure to obtain
            in the scramble to leave campus. I followed the tutorial here (https://iot-guider.com/arduino/serial-communication-between-two-arduino-boards/)
            to learn the basics of getting two Arduno Unos to communicate with each other through the <RX>
            pins.   
        </p>
        <p>Essentially, the transmitting Uno board would send out the string, "Hello" and the 
            receiving Uno would print this out in its serial monitor, along with the string, 
            "received." This simple project made me realize that I could have probably done this 
            on an LCD display but since I didn't have on, I stuck to the serial monitor for this assignment.

    <h3>Using Radio Communication to Light a Bulb!</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <br><p>Using the nRF24L01+ transceiver module, I was able to make the Uno boards communicate with each other 
          wirelessly. The module is designed to operate in 2.4 GHz worldwide ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) frequency band, which is one of the
          bands reserved internationally for the use of unlicensed low-powered devices, and uses GFSK modulation for data transmission. 
      </p>
      <p>The operating voltage is from 1.9-3.6V but the logic pins are 5V tolerant, so it can be connected to the Uno without any converter. They are the most common 
          modules used because of their low current draw (26 microamps in standby mode and 900 nanoamps at power down mode). 
      </p>
      <p>The transciever module communicate over a 4-pin SPI. The SPI bus uses a concept of a Master and Slave. In this exmaple,
          the Arduino is the Master and the radio module is the slave. This module uses an on-board antenna that allows for a more compact
          version of the breakout. The smaller antenna means a lower transmission range, allowing for communication with over a 100 meters in distance (without walls...).

      <p>****I think a lot of credit probably goes to my friend Meghan for this idea. I am no owner of this and thank her wholeheartedly for 
          saving me some time the night before.

      <p>Using this pinout diagram, I hooked up the module to the Uno board using male head wires to the following pins in order from left to right, top to bottom: 
          3.3V, digital 10, digital 11, (right one left empty); GND, digital 9, digital 13, and digital 12.  </p>
      <p>I then set this up in Arduino with the following code:</p><br>
      <h4>Transmitting Board Code</h4>
      <img  src="setup.PNG" 
      class="horizontalcenter; verticalcenter;" style="width:105%;transform: rotate(0deg);display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" alt="centered image"><br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h4>Transmitting Board</h4>
      <p>I wired up the module to the same I/O pins on both the transmitter and receiver boards</p>

      class="img-responsive" style="width:100%; transform: rotate(0deg); display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" alt="Image"><br>

      <p> As you can see in the code to the left, radio.begin(); initiated the radio module signal and 
          radio.openWritingPipe(address) set up the address where the data was being sent. The radio.stopListening(); command 
        set up the module as the transmitter and the radio.startListening(); set up the receiving module. </p>

        <p>Using these loops, I then created two button states: one High and one Low. When the button was pressed (i.e. state=HIGH), the 
            radio module would write this text and send it over to the receiver which would read the data with its radio module 
            and determine which state the button was in with an if statement. This conditional, when true, would then turn the pin connected to the LED on HIGH if the 
            button was pressed, thus allowing current to flow through the LED to light it up!   </p>

        <br><p>Using the same steps in the previous activity, I made a button-operated servo motor that would rotate up to 120 degrees repeatedly. 
        </p>
        <p>When the button was pushed, the conditional on the receiving side would write to the servo motor, causing it to rotate. This 
            was quite simple, especially after the much of the struggle involved in trying to figure out the code for the button-operated 
            LED was in the past. This did, however, give me an idea to do the same with DC motors (say driving a tiny robot) that could 
            be remotely operated. Maybe to bring me water. Or a snack. From the couch to the kitchen (yeah it's about to wind down to those times...).
