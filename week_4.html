      <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p> This week's assignment was to program a microcontroller to do something. </p><br>
      <h4>Materials and Software Used</h4>
        <p>Arduino Uno, Arduino/C, breadboard, ultrasonic range sensor, motor driver, soldering</p><br>
      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Microcontrollers such as the Arduino Uno and the Itsy Bitsy M4 are based on a single integrated circuit chip 
          that can take inputs from modules such as sensors and switches and porduce a desired output through an actuator, 
          bulb, buzzer, speaker, or solenoid, to name a few.  </p><br>
      <h3>Making my Uno do something</h3>
        <p>I wanted to initially make a tiny skateboard that would coast autonomously, come to a stop if it came close to an object, and then go backwards.  
        </p>
        <p>But... time constraints! YAY! So I decided to just make a motor rotate based on values outputted by the ultrasonic sensor.

      <h4>Ardunio Uno</h4>
      <p>The Ardunio Uno is one of the easiest microcontrollers to use (and is why the microncontroller of choice for most beginners).
        It has 14 digital input/output pins (6 of which can be used as PWM outputs), and 6 analog inputs. It is easily 
        programmable with the Ardunio IDE via a USB cable or 9V battery. I will be using a few of the digital pins for the 
        motor driver and ultrasonic sensor and the power and ground pins for my circuit.   </p><br>

      class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <h4>HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</h4>
      <p>The only type of ultrasonic range sensor that I could find in the lab was the Arduino HC-SR04 (Ultra-sonic "ping" senosr),
        which easily connected to the Ardunio Uno which were plenty on hand. Ultrasound waves are high-pitched 
      sound waves whose frequencies are beyond the audible limit of human hearing. This sensor is composed of two 
      ultrasonic transducers -- one that trasmits the converted electrical signal to utrasound waves and one that receives 
      the transmitted pulses, producing an output proportional to the distance the pulse travelled.   </p><br>

      <h4>L298 Motor Driver Module</h4>
      <p>With most microncontrollers like the Arduino, driving an LED is no problem since the current draw is so low (about 
        20 mA). Driving a DC motor, however, requires a lot of current (the motor I will be using has no-load current of 70mA).
        This is where motor drivers come in. This motor driver has an H-bridge which allows for direction control and another 
        source of power supply that is sufficient to drive the 6V motor (the Uno can only output a maximum of 5V). The driver has 
        four inputs, but since I will be using only one motor, I will only be needing two of these. </p><br>

      <p>After connecting my Arduino to my computer, I threw on the infrared sensor onto the breadboard, gave it some power, and wallah! We had sensor 
          readings in no time! Easy.  
      </p>
      <p>Then I decided to throw on the motor. This was at first a little difficult since the motors I had took in 6V and I could only 
          output 5V from the Uno. Instead of looking for a bunch of stuff (i.e. transistors, diodes, resistors) to connect my motor, I found a motor 
          driver instead! I quickly hooked that up (even though the connections were giving me a pain) and woo -- had a spinning motor shaft! </p>

                <p>The motor driver unfortunately can only take two motors so I might have to use another if I do decide to continue 
                    working on a skateboard. Fortunately, the shaft was able to spin this wooden ball that that I was about to use as 
                    the wheels before Rob saved the day with Lego wheels! 
                 <p>I have never been so happy for Lego wheels. Long live Lego lovers! </p>

              <h4>The Rotating Motor</h3>
                <p>After assigning the pin values to the variables I used in my code, I made a loop that ran on forever, taking the 
                    sensor values and comparing it to the number 10 (cm away from the sensor). I used an if statement to make the 
                    motor spin clockwise at maximum speed if the sensor values were outputting values greater than 10 and made the 
                    motor stop spinning if the values read less than 10 (object comes too close to the board).
