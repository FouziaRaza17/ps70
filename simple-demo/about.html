        <h3>School Life</h3>
        <p>I am concentrating in biomedical engineering with a secondary in 
          Mind, Brain, and Behavior. I am currently taking Physics 12A, Math 21B, 
          and Bioelectronics. I am involved in the Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club
          where I am making a sumobot for a training project or the following semester. 
          I am also working in the Harvard Biodesign Lab that works with robotic exosuits
          to help people with mobility impairments improve their walking.

        <h3>Home Life</h3>
        <p>I hail from Miami, Florida and enjoy spending time with my twin sister
          during breaks and play volleyball with my friends on the beach. I also love 
          watching Jeopardy! during dinner and never pass up the offer to be challenged!

        <h3>Other Life</h3>
        <p>I have missed out on a decade worth of movies -- so if you have a suggestion,
          I will add it to my growing list of GOATs and classics! I also would like to learn
          to play the cello. If you have one collecting dust in your garage, I will gladly pay
          the shipping fee and help with spring cleaning while I'm at it.
